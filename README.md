# Voice Emotion Recognition using ML (RAVDESS Dataset)

Welcome to the Voice Emotion Recognition AI project!  
This project detects emotions from speech audio using machine learning techniques.  

## Features

- Predicts emotions like **neutral**, **happy**, **angry**, **sad**, etc.
- Uses **MFCC** features from audio.
- Built with **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
- Includes a simple **Gradio UI**.
- Trained on the **RAVDESS** dataset.

## Dataset

- Dataset: [RAVDESS - Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)
- Audio samples of 24 actors expressing 8 emotions.

## Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install librosa soundfile scikit-learn numpy pandas gradio
````

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raniakhan1/Voice-Emotion-Recognition.git

   ```
2. Launch the Gradio 
3. A web interface will open. Upload a .wav file to detect emotion.
